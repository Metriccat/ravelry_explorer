# analysis conclusion from Rav

# general remarks
limit approx for API GET request: 5000 items (on one page)

# tag frequancies in projects 

data: projects/search.json?page_size=5000&craft=knitting&sort=favorites"

most faved projects have same-ish tags as the rest: favs pretty much follow general distribution
most tags used only once
most used tags: cardigan, baby, shawl, cables (followed by colorwork and lace)
TODO: same with actual pattern category instead of tags (self-reporting), but needs crossing with patterns

# stash 

avoid "yarn" search: no info regarding popularity, less interesting appart from ratings maybe
? sort by most favorites: first item has -1 fav count !
"favorites" search order coresponds to yarn with most faves, not stash item ?

col;or ditributions: changes non negligibly when sorting by #faves or best match
entries with pics have a better chance of having more infos slike color
=> use as filter at GET level to have more data (limit at 5000)

################ general ideas:
simple things: nbr of people, of projects in each yarn weight, total value of stashed yarns 
(split by indie/not indie ? difficult to evaluate)
most favorited yarn weight (sum favs for this weight)
color as function of season: not interesting because there is winter green and spring green, and no split between the 2
better: retrieve photos and do img analysis, but long and may not be ok in bulk due to copyright ? maybe ok with thumbs, enough for color
most active knitters nbr projects, most notes ...
world map with nbr projects/user average
word cloud designers in projects containing tweed, lopi ...  designer linked to pattern => merge pattern search
word cloud people fav swear word
estimate total value of stash on ravelry
pick high potential patterns (brooklyn tweed) and alltimestars
and follow nbr of favorites over time
yarn: color, wieght distribution in stashes
which yarns have most faves: seems not informative many faves on non-yarn entries, search by reccently added ? prb seasons
which yarns are all used up

provide link to online r palette maker snippet if people want to experiment with color interpretation

general complex questions with interesting answers:
which projects have more favorites (reflects population tastes)
ie: which type (clothing...), which color(s), which weight, baby/not baby, which yarns type
how to get projects for a pattern (=sales!); correlates with nbr queued ? nbr projects faved ? nbr of faves ?
which designers are most knitted; correlates with faved , queued ? (role of reputation)
general simple questions: nbr projects, finished, avg stash size ...
text mining on forum posts by group
where the shops are (latitude, longitude)


# API requests
get number of matches for result in paginator attributes (query gives always 10000) ?

people serach result not in api (fav curse word, colors and people's locations)

search by color/weight in projects, but project data does not include color family 
=> include it in project attributes ?
prb: this comes from stash database ... same prb with pattern info (weight) searchable but not accessible in projects
